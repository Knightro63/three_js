A 3D rendering engine for dart (based on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [three_dart](https://github.com/wasabia/three_dart)) that allows users to view, edit and manipulate their 3D objects. The current builds only include a openGL for desktop and mobile, and webGL for web applications.
